Implement (high priority):
- assignment of builtin functions to a variable
- recursive functions
- mutually recursive functions
- all basic operations (< = + - / * ...)
- name mangling for produced C++
- function overloading
- dynamic multi dispatch (multimethod)
- boxing/unboxing of Any_
- arrays
- lists
- macro
- map, filter, reduce/fold, ...
- i/o functions
- runtime generation based on usage
- nested function definitions
- lambdas

Implement (delayed):
- closures
- better error reporting
- emit warnings
- optimizations phase
- support command line flags

Compilation perfomance:
- how much times Type is evaluated for same nodes. Maybe it can be improved
- check if we can gain benefits from object pool/arena for ast nodes

To check:
- measure perfomance of ReMatch switch vs nested switch.

Fix:
- Want to use StrView inside token and other structs with {char*,len}, 
  but it increases total size due to padding. Maybe something like trait can work?
- New types get Id of 1..N, instead of 0..N, because operator[] for map returns
  entry if it exists OR create a new, so after it misses, new entry is created.
