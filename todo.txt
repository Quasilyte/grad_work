Implement:
- better type inference
- assignment of builtin functions to a variable

Compilation perfomance:
- how much times Type is evaluated for same nodes. Maybe it can be improved
- check if we can gain benefits from object pool/arena for ast nodes

Fix:
- Want to use StrView inside token and other structs with {char*,len}, 
  but it increases total size due to padding. Maybe something like trait can work?
