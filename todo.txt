Implement:
- id transformations (because we can not map lisp id into C id directly)
- better type inference
- assignment of builtin functions to a variable

Compilation perfomance:
- how much times Type is evaluated for same nodes. Maybe it can be improved
- check if we can gain benefits from object pool/arena for ast nodes
