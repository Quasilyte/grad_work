Implement (high priority):
- rework some special forms into functions (maybe type casts should be functions)
- higher order functions (function as a type)
- assignment of builtin functions to a variable
- mutually recursive functions
- all basic operations (< = + - / * ...)
- name mangling for produced C++
- dynamic multi dispatch (multimethod)
- boxing/unboxing of Any_
- arrays
- lists
- macro
- map, filter, reduce/fold, ...
- i/o functions
- runtime generation based on usage
- nested function definitions
- lambdas
- pattern matching
- stack of errors
- generate correct code for C (based on template)
- call with apply (list or args)
- constructors/destructors, some kind of encapsulation & invariants
+ function overloading
+ recursive functions
- tail recursion optimization

Implement (delayed):
- closures
- better error reporting
- emit warnings
- optimizations phase
- support command line flags
- nested struct attr lookup (like embedding in Go)
- tuples
- better type inference (especially useful for overloaded functions)
- argument dependent lookup (for passing overloaded functions)

Compilation perfomance:
- how much times Type is evaluated for same nodes. Maybe it can be improved
- check if we can gain benefits from object pool/arena for ast nodes

To check:
- measure perfomance of ReMatch switch vs nested switch.
  http://www.stroustrup.com/OOPSLA-typeswitch-draft.pdf
- check generator vs name mangling perfomance impact.

Fix:
- want to use StrView inside token and other structs with {char*,len}, 
  but it increases total size due to padding. Maybe something like trait can work?
- new types get Id of 1..N, instead of 0..N, because operator[] for map returns
  entry if it exists OR create a new, so after it misses, new entry is created.
- merge alist & hlist into single class, if possible
- sig_matcher should be reused in memory, but beware of nested keys;
  for example, function call inside function call may also need overloading lookup.
