All globals have zero value even _before_ initializer expression
is evaluated. This resolves the situation where a global initialized 
by a function which uses that global variable to calculate return value.
So, the function will see zero value for variable, making it possible
to execute function before the global variable fully defined.
Note: global variable is fully defined when its initializer expression
is evaluated (always at run time).
